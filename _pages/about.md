I am a UC San Diego computer science and bioinformatics major with experience in developing computational pipelines, analyzing proteomic and transcriptomic datasets, and applying machine learning to biological problems. I am skilled in Python, R, and C++, with additional experience in Docker, AWS, and high-performance computing.

# Computational Biology

As an undergraduate researcher, I am working on several projects including a computational pipeline for adhesin classification, benchmarking several new host filtration programs, RNA-seq analysis on spinal cord injury data. You can read one of my recent NSF research posters [here](https://www.thinglink.com/view/scene/2012270918608355814).

# Web Development

I developed pages and assets for two websites, Veteran Sisters and 4FLOT, as a full stack web developer at Triton Software Engineering, which you can view [here](https://tritonse.github.io/projects/). I am also currently building a website for the Undergraduate Bioinformatics Club solo, and you can see my current progress [here](https://ubic-website-cole.web.app).
