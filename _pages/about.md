I am a **Computer Science and Bioinformatics** major at **UC San Diego** with experience in developing computational pipelines, analyzing proteomic and transcriptomic datasets, and applying machine learning to biological problems. I am proficient in **Python**, **R**, and **C++**, with additional experience in **Docker**, **AWS**, and **high-performance computing (HPC)** environments.

# Computational Biology

As an undergraduate researcher, I am involved in several projects, including:

- Developing a **computational pipeline for adhesin classification**, including a machine learning classifier model
- **Benchmarking** new host filtration programs
- Performing **RNA-seq analysis** on spinal cord injury datasets

You can read one of my recent **NSF research posters** [here](https://www.thinglink.com/view/scene/2012270918608355814).

# Web Development

As a full-stack web developer with **Triton Software Engineering**, I contributed to pages and assets for two websites: [Veteran Sisters and 4FLOT](https://tritonse.github.io/projects/).  
I am also currently designing and building the **Undergraduate Bioinformatics Club** website independently — you can see my current progress [here](https://ubic-website-cole.web.app).
